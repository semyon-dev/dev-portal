***SingularityNET (SNET)*** is a platform that allows developers to publish and monetize their AI services through blockchain. Any user across the internet can access these services. An internal token - AGIX, is used for payment.

## Capabilities

The platform covers a wide range of services in the field of AI and machine learning:
- Model inference and training;
- Image, video, speech, text processing, and time series analysis;
- Biological data and network analytics.

You can offer anything from simple solutions like a pathfinding algorithm to complex products for the entire industries or stand-alone AI applications. It's also possible to create autonomous AI agents that interact with other services on the platform.

## Architecture

SingularityNET consists of several key points that ensure its operation:
- Minimizing dependency on blockchains like [Ethereum](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/UsedTechnologies/ethereum-address/) to increase speed and reduce costs;
- Abstract approach to integrating AI services, simplifying the [publishing](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/ServiceOnboardingViaPublisher/) and usage process;
- Support for regulatory compliance without sacrificing openness.

## Benefits for Developers

- Simplicity: The platform is easy to master thanks to a universal tool â€” the [Daemon](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/Daemon/), which ensures scalability, resilience, and service management, as well as handles payments for services. The Daemon is a decentralized tool.
- Scalability: Your services can handle large numbers of users without losing performance.
- Openness: To make our marketplace compliant with regulations without compromising on openness, we implemented it separately from our fully decentralized registry of AI services currently available on the Blockchain.
