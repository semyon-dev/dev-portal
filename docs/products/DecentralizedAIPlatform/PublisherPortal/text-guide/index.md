## How to create&start Daemon (billing & service setup)

### It requires some preparation:

1. Create an [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) account that will be used by your daemon to interact with the blockchain and generate API key
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/InfuraHomePage.webp" alt="HomePage"/>
2. After visiting the Infura homepage, you will already have one generated API key, you can copy it
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/InfuraKey.webp" alt="Key"/>
3. The address of your generated key must be specified in the daemon config. It will be used to validate daemon calls on the blockchain network
   After downloading the service and publishing it (PUBLISHED status), you can complete the daemon config

4. Passthrough_endpoint is the endpoint on which your service is located, to which the daemon will send user requests.
5. Pvt_key_for_metering – key that we generate in Infura
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/CreatingDaemonConfig.webp" alt="Config"/>
6. Copy config or download a JSON file

The JSON file will look something like this

```json
{
    "blockchain_enabled": true,
    "blockchain_network_selected": "sepolia",
    "daemon_end_point": "0.0.0.0:62401",
    "daemon_group_name": "default_group",
    "ipfs_end_point": "http://ipfs.singularitynet.io:80",
    "organization_id": "Naint1",
    "service_id": "ServNaint7",
    "passthrough_enabled": true,
    "passthrough_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:7004",
    "payment_channel_cert_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/client.pem",
    "payment_channel_ca_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/ca.pem",
    "payment_channel_key_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/client-key.pem",
    "ssl_cert": "/home/nlp/certs/domain/fullchain.pem",
    "ssl_key": "/home/nlp/certs/domain/privkey.pem",
    "payment_channel_storage_type": "etcd",
    "log": { "level": "debug", "output": { "type": "stdout" } }
}
```

### Now we will install the daemon and run it with the downloaded config

1. Download daemon config according to your system
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/DownloadDaemon.webp" alt="Download Daemon"/>

2. Change rules on Daemon file using ‘chmod’ util

```sh
chmod +x snetd-linux-amd64-v5.1.3
```

3. Start screen util (If you haven't this util you need install it). It is necessary that the session with started demon does not end when you close terminal.
   screen -S YourName
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/ChmodAndScreenCommands.webp" alt="Screen"/>
4. Start Daemon in this session
   ./snetd-linux-amd64-v5.1.3 -c snetd.config.json
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/ConfigPowershell.webp" alt="Config"/>
5. Press Ctrl + A + D to disconnect from screen session
6. Check daemon:

```sh
curl localhost:62401/heartbeat
```
