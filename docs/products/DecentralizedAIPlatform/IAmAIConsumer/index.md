**_SingularityNET_** is an open and decentralized platform for AI services powered by blockchain technology. Developers can publish their services, while consumers can access them with all the advantages of web3.

## Platform Capabilities

The platform covers various areas of AI and machine learning: image and video processing, speech and text analysis, time series, bioengineering, and more. Services range from simple algorithms to complex niche solutions for different industries.

## Ease of Use

You can use AI services through a convenient web interface of [AI Marketplace](/docs/products/AIMarketplace/), as well as integrate AI services into your applications using our integration tools.

AI services integration is simplified by means of tools like the [SingularityNET SDK](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/SDK/sdk-concept/) available for Python and several other programming languages and [SingularityNET CLI](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/CLI/) which covers most platform functions in one simple and convenient interface. SDK designed to provide a programming interface that helps developers to automate interaction with AI services. The CLI tool allows any kind of user to interact with the platform in a decentralized way. There is a separate short guide for each component to help you set everything up from scratch to perfection.

## Compliance with Regulations

Registration of AI services is done separately from the marketplace, which helps comply with legal requirements without sacrificing openness.
