# How Loyalty Rewards work

In the SingularityNET Phase Two proposal, 5% of tokens minted each month are allocated to creating a special “Loyalty Rewards Pool”. These tokens are allocated to express the gratitude of SingularityNET to Phase One AGIX token holders for supporting the Phase Two initiative, and to create an opportunity to incentivize and reward community growth through new token holders on the Cardano blockchain.
The Phase Two plan made a clear distinction between the distribution of tokens from the first 12 months of AGIX-ADA minting, and those minted from year 2 onwards. Distribution of tokens minted during the first 12-month cycle is to be initiated via mechanics determined by the SingularityNET organization, while the community has the opportunity to update the distribution mechanics thereafter.

Cardano Claiming Special Instructions
Due to the way that transferring a native asset on the Cardano network works, users will need to deposit about 2 ADA from the wallet they are claiming the rewards to (in order to cover for sending the AGIX tokens). Users will receive these back together with the AGIX Loyalty Reward Tokens.

## AGI Balance
Minimum of 10 AGI

## Accocation
Rewards are proportional to token balance during the snapshot. Staking Bonus: AGI Tokens which were staked on staking.singularitynet.io at the time of the snapshot will qualify for a 20% bonus on top of the allocated loyalty rewards.

## ADA transferred
Please give it at least 24 hours to receive ADA and AGIX tokens.

## Distribution Period
There will be six monthly allocations, starting November 22nd, 2022 and the last one becoming available at April 18th, 2023.
